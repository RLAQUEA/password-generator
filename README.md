# Password Generator 


When the user opens the page, there is a box that says Generate Password that when clicked, prompts the user to enter the number of characters they would like the password to be.  


It must be between 8 and 128 characters.  


If the user enters a number outside of that established range, the program will alert the user, and prompt them to enter another value between 8 and 128 characters.  


Then, once the proper number of characters is entered, the user will be asked to confirm a number of queries for whether they will have special, numeric, uppercase and lowercase letters in the password.  


Once they confirm these checkpoints, the program will generate a password with the established possible characters.
